Description: The main dataset for this project contained some basic information on the reviewer, their review and a summary. Linear regression was used to assess relationships within the data. Decision trees regressors were applied to enhance predictive accuracy. Clustering identified key customer segments for targeted marketing, while natural language processing (NLP) techniques provided insights from customer reviews. 

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, linear regression, data visualisation, sentiment analysis, word clouds

Technology: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Linear regression, decision tree regressors,OLS

Results: The analysis identified key factors influencing loyalty points. A multilinear regression model showed improved accuracy, while clustering revealed five customer segments, with clusters 1 and 2 as prime marketing targets. Sentiment analysis of reviews highlighted opportunities to promote high-rated products and improve those with lower scores.
